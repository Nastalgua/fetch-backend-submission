# Fetch Backend Submission
### Summary
This submission is built using Python and the Flask framework. This was developed on a M1 Mac machine, so commands for Windows may be give or take 🤷.

### Clone This Repository
1. I guess this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=49kJgbFIOTZnJ_mx) works?
2. `cd` into the project (assume all the following commands run the `root` directory of this project).

### Python & Flask Installation
1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You may need to add a path to the installation depending on the OS you are running this.
2. Make a separate environment: `python3 -m venv .venv` (MacOS) or `py -3 -m venv .venv` (Windows).
3. Activate the environment: `. .venv/bin/activate` (MacOS) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
4. `pip install Flask`.

### Dependencies
To install all dependencies used in this submission, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Run Tests
PyTest was used for unit testing. To run all written test, use `pytest`.
To perform end to end testing (after the API starts), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a good choice for sending API requests.

### Starting API
Run the command `python app.py`. It should start the API on `http://localhost:8000/`.
